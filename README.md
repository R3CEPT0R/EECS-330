### Problem Statement

One of the greatest problems regarding language acquisition is getting more individuals to learn a newlanguage fast and efficiently. When we were children, we were able to pick up a language naturally in a few months, so this wasn’t a problem. However, this is not the case
once we mature. According to the Foreign Service Institute, it takes anywhere between 24 to 88 weeks on average to acquire a new language, assuming that the learner has an above average aptitude for learning languages, a classroom environment, time during the day, and is a native speaker of English [1]. All of these assumptions definitely don’t apply to everyone, so it can take years of study and dedication in order to make the same strides as when we were infants. How then, can we keep users interested and motivated to learn? What could this mean for the world if such a task were to be accomplished? This is where the motivation comes from, for not only would there be a more globally connected population, but if successful, the system could also be expanded to other areas such as STEM or other general or specialized fields, and make intellectual endeavors a want instead of a must. This, in effect, would create a more passionate and educated population, and help in other areas to advance society as a whole. Additionally, the platform would be completely free, meaning that individuals, regardless of economic status, would be able to learn without a financial barrier and whenever is most convenient for them.
